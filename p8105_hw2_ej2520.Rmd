## Problem 1

This is the start of Homework 2 for P8105: Data Science 1. First, we are going to attach the packages needed for this homework.  

```{r Loading Packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

Next, we are going to import and clean the NYC Transit Subway dataset. 

```{r Importing Data}
transit_df = 
  read_csv(file = "NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) |>
janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"),
    entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```
